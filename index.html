                            “STUDENT” IS AN ODE TO THE UNPARALLELED CRITICISM IN STUDENTS' LIVES. THIS TRACK NOT ONLY ADDRESSES
                            THE STRUGGLES OF STUDENTS BUT ALSO SHEDS LIGHT ON THE HARASSMENT EXPERIENCED BY UNDERPRIVILEGED STUDENTS.

                            THIS COMPOSITION EXPLORES THE NOTION THAT AFTER DEATH, ONE IS LEFT UNATTENDED,
                            EVEN BY THOSE LOVED ONES WHO VOWED TO REMAIN BY THEIR SIDE. IN JUST A MATTER OF DAYS,
                            ONE IS CREMATED AND DEPARTS, WHILE OTHERS CONTINUE WITH THEIR LIVES. IT ENCAPSULATES
                            THE SOLITARY JOURNEY OF LIFE, FROM ARRIVING ALONE TO DEPARTING ALONE. DESPITE ONGOING
                            RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS, THE PERSPECTIVE PRESENTED SUGGESTS THAT RELIGION HOLDS NO
                            SIGNIFICANCE ONCE THE PHYSICAL BODY HAS CEASED TO EXIST.
